# Authentic Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani)

This classic Indian dish is a perfect introduction to Indian cuisine for beginners. The creamy, rich sauce pairs beautifully with tender chicken pieces, making it a favorite among both kids and adults.

## Why This Recipe Works

- **Authentic flavors**: Uses traditional Indian spices and cooking techniques
- **Creamy texture**: The combination of yogurt, cream, and butter creates a luxurious sauce
- **Balanced heat**: Perfect level of spiciness that can be adjusted to taste
- **Make-ahead friendly**: The sauce can be prepared in advance and reheated

## Pro Tips

1. **Marinate overnight**: For the best flavor, marinate the chicken overnight in the refrigerator
2. **Don't skip the yogurt**: It tenderizes the chicken and adds tanginess to balance the richness
3. **Cook on medium heat**: This prevents the spices from burning and ensures even cooking
4. **Taste and adjust**: Always taste the sauce before adding the chicken and adjust seasoning as needed

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve with warm naan bread or basmati rice
- Pair with a simple cucumber salad or raita
- Add a side of vegetable curry for a complete meal
- Garnish with fresh cilantro and a dollop of yogurt

## Storage Instructions

- Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days
- Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of cream if needed
- Freeze for up to 2 months, thaw in the refrigerator before reheating
