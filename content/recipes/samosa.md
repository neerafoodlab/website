# Crispy Vegetable Samosas

Samosas are one of India's most beloved snacks, perfect for tea time or as an appetizer. These crispy, golden triangles filled with spiced potatoes and peas are sure to be a hit at any gathering.

## The Perfect Samosa

The key to perfect samosas lies in:
- **Crispy outer shell**: Made with the right flour-to-fat ratio
- **Well-seasoned filling**: Balanced spices and proper texture
- **Proper sealing**: Prevents oil from entering during frying
- **Right oil temperature**: Ensures even cooking and golden color

## Pro Tips for Success

1. **Dough consistency**: Should be stiff but pliable
2. **Filling texture**: Not too wet, not too dry
3. **Sealing technique**: Use water to seal edges properly
4. **Oil temperature**: Test with a small piece of dough
5. **Frying method**: Medium heat for even cooking

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve with mint chutney or tamarind sauce
- Pair with hot masala chai
- Great as party appetizers
- Perfect for picnics and potlucks

## Storage Tips

- Store uncooked samosas in the freezer
- Fry directly from frozen (no need to thaw)
- Keep fried samosas warm in a low oven
- Best consumed fresh for maximum crispiness
